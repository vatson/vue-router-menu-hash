      <code>Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever.    An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud. You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever.</code>

      <code>Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament. I think the only card she has is the Lorem card.  That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10.</code>

      <code>   Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words.</code>

      <code>If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it.  My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women.  That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10.</code>

      <code>Despite the constant negative ipsum covfefe.  I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee.</code>

      <code> An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE. I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament.</code>

      <code>All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.  Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.  I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable.</code>

      <code>I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words.
